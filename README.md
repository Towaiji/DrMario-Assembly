# Dr. Mario - Assembly Implementation

## Overview
This project is an Assembly language implementation of the classic **Dr. Mario** game. The goal of the project is to recreate the fundamental gameplay mechanics of **Dr. Mario** using low-level programming with the **Saturn assembler** to gain a deeper understanding of computer architecture and low-level logic design.

## Features
- Basic game mechanics inspired by the original **Dr. Mario**.
- Tetris-like gameplay where the player matches colors to eliminate viruses.
- Real-time input handling for smooth gameplay.
- Efficient memory management and rendering using Assembly language.

## Technologies Used
- **Assembly Language**
- **MIPS Architecture** (if applicable, otherwise specify the architecture used)
- **Saturn Assembler** (for assembling and running the program)

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- MIPS Assembler (e.g., **MARS**, **SPIM**, or your preferred tool).
- Basic understanding of Assembly language.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Towaiji/DrMario-Assembly.git
